- 👋 Hi, my name is Tyler Bonnell, I am an Informatics and Data Management Epidemiologist with the Snohomish County Department of Health (in Washington state).
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, public health informatics, data visualization, and injury and violence prevention.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL (traditionally I have worked in R) as well as supervised machine learning methods, primarily those available through `scikit-learn` at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source code projects that will benefit the public health analytic and epidemiological communities (at the national, state, and/or local level).
- 📫 How to reach me: [Tyler.Bonnell@co.snohomish.wa.us](mailto:Tyler.Bonnell@co.snohomish.wa.us)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
